My team and I were given 5 weeks to complete research on a client of our choice to develop a concept that would provide value to their company and audience. My roles were UI designer and UX researcher which required me to work on the art direction, prototyping, market research, as well as project management."},{"item":null,"type":"Video","title":"FINNEAS - Only A Lifetime","videoId":"kn2flZlUY7c"},{"item":null,"type":"Group","content":[{"item":null,"type":"TextList","title":"Role","items":["UI/UX design","Art direction","User research","Protoyping"]},{"item":null,"type":"TextList","title":"Tools","items":["Figma","ProCreate","Photoshop"]},{"item":null,"type":"TextList","title":"Team","items":["Jocelyn Qiao","Raphie Robles","Peter Huang"]}]},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Our Client","body":"C.P. Company, previously known as Chester Perry, is a premium sportswear brand and pioneers of garment-dyeing technology. They are committed to being authentic, innovative, and globally Italian."}]},{"section":null,"title":"proposal","content":[{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Opportunity","body":"Archived garment collections, extensive panel discussions, detailed process videos, and the stories of the founder Massimo Osti are scattered throughout C.P. Company's online platforms yet gaining no attention. Their consumers do not feel connected to the brand because the content provided is communicated as general advertisements instead of rich stories. Upon further research into defining C.P. Company's customers and what they value, my team and I discovered how we can leverage its existing content to appeal to newer audiences."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Goal","body":"The goal of our design intervention is to provide value to C.P. Company and to appeal to their upcoming generation of consumers. We want to create a product that will generate awareness of their significant history in being the pioneers of garment-dyeing technology as well as lead their consumers to purchase C.P. Company's products directly from their own site rather than from external retailers that carry the brand."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Ideation","body":"Initially, we considered adding a page on their website called “Your Story”. This feature was meant to help users decide on which product and material would suit their use case the most as C.P. Company specializes in sportswear."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"Screenshot of Initial Layout Design"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"After creating the mockup, we learned that it provides no real value other than making it a little easier for first time customers to navigate through the different options available. My team and I quickly decided against this approach and began to brainstorm further."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"CPC_OppVid.png","alt":"C.P. Company Design Opportunity Video Pitch"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"We took a look at other successful luxury brands and took note of how their digital platforms were engaging their consumers, specifically with the Gen Z and HENRYs (High Earner, Not Rich Yet). From this, we decided on creating a mobile app experience that would showcase the highlights and components that make C.P. Company unique."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Prototype","body":"Before we reached the final stages of prototyping, we split up our ideation process and focused on the parts that work. Since our client wanted to start catering to a younger generation, I proposed that we make use of the interactions that this generation is familiar with to navigate through apps such as Instagram and Snapchat. I also wanted to make sure the app has a key feature that will provide the users with something more than just another e-commerce interface which is why I designed the “Create” feature."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"CPC_create.png","alt":"Video Snippet of the Create Feature"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"The “Create” feature is meant to highlight and make use of their unique Bespoke garment dyeing technology service that they offer to their customers. It is similar to Nike's Nike By You service where their consumers can choose which material and style they want to custom dye. However, I wanted to make this process more personalized and special to the user by encouraging them to take a picture of their surroundings to create palettes that mean something to them. These palettes are meant to help the users find garments that will suit their environment or match their current wardrobe."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"CPC_interaction.png","alt":"Video Snippet of App Interaction"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"Procreate's palette maker feature as well as C.P. Company's rich history and stories is what inspired my design. The “Create” feature will allow this new generation to remember the places they have been through colour palettes and give them the opportunity to find something that will commemorate that memory."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Conclusion","body":"Although there were tight time constraints, I believe my team and I were able to create something unique and valuable for our client. Although there were areas where we could improve on, the “Create” feature I worked on was well received by the teaching team and guest alumni mentors. As someone with limited prior experience doing user interface and experience design, I learned significantly from this project about the process that goes behind making a successful and well thought out product."}]}],"pageTitle":"C.P.
