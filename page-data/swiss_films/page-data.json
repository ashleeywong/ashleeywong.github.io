The purpose of this project was to create an expressive yet functional site to surface the content of SWISS FILMS through a combination of effective art direction, content strategy, and interaction design. My role was lead UI/UX designer which required me to work on the art direction, prototyping, interaction design, as well as project management. *Please note: A fully completed interactive prototype was not required for this project."},{"item":null,"type":"Group","content":[{"item":null,"type":"TextList","title":"Role","items":["UI/UX design","Art direction","Protoyping","Project Management"]},{"item":null,"type":"TextList","title":"Tools","items":["Figma","After Effects"]},{"item":null,"type":"TextList","title":"Team","items":["Jocelyn Qiao","Raphie Robles","Peter Huang"]}]},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"The Client","body":"SWISS FILMS is a non-profit organization that works to promote Swiss films globally by connecting their filmmakers to an international network of opportunities."}]},{"section":null,"title":"process","content":[{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Goal","links":[{"keyword":"www.swissfilms.ch","address":"https://www.swissfilms.ch/"}],"body":"The goal of this project was to explore different design qualities to create an expressive yet functional microsite while using the content found on SWISS FILMS' existing website (www.swissfilms.ch). *Their official website has now been updated since then, we worked with the content provided at that time in October 2021."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Exploration","body":"At the initial stage of this project, my team and I created mockups separately to explore our creativity in expressive art direction. As the focus of our client is on promoting Swiss made films and creators, we wanted to highlight the cinematography by presenting their work as full bleed previews upon hover."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"screenshot of exploration stage"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"video of first prototype"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"However, I noticed that although our mockups were aesthetically experimental, they still felt too static and not compelling enough for users to curiously navigate through."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Ideation","body":"In order to move forward with our expressive microsite, we decided we needed to frame the project differently and cut out the parts that made us static. We scratched out the traditional interactions and layout of websites that we were incorporating and started with a blank canvas. \n\n We began to brainstorm some new concepts related to our client that we can expand on to further evoke an emotion from their audience."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"New Concept","body":"- Have interactions that allude to techniques used in film/cinema that will then inform our design decisions and make for a content-driven site \n\n - Nostalgic/romanticism about watching a film in the cinema (in this age of watching films at home, cinema and film festivals grounds people and brings them together)"}]},{"section":null,"title":"final product","content":[{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Prototype","body":""},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"final prototype"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"I designed the layout on Figma based on our new concept. I combined a few elements related to film in our final prototype by taking inspiration from cameras and film strips as our precedents."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"1) Timeline Navigation Bar \n The bar on the left presents the date of when the film was produced which can be either clicked on or navigated through by scrolling to show the correlated film. This “timeline” navigation bar is inspired by the zoom focus ring on cameras."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"final prototype"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"2) Landing Page Snippets \n The video snippets on the landing page move in and out as you scroll down or up. This was designed to give users the feeling of looking through a film reel."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"final prototype"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"3) Hamburger Menu \n While experimenting with the layout, I added small squares on the right side of the page to mimic the film perforations on the sides of film strips. I felt that this made the layout look too busy and decided to simplify it. The three film perforations that were left reminded me of a hamburger menu, which allowed us to seamlessly use it as a functional design element as well."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"final prototype"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"","body":"4) The Loading Animation \n I designed the loading animation screen to resemble a film leader countdown to notify the users who have clicked into a film title that a film snippet will be playing shortly."},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"final prototype"},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Conclusion","body":"We were able to see what wasn't working and restart which resulted in a much better project that had elements that were praised by the teaching team. Although we did not have enough time to create a fully functional microsite, it has been a project that really pushed me to think outside of the box and opened me up to more unconventional user interface design.
