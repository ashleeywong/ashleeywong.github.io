I knew I wanted to base my shop off of my own original character, which is when I started doodling bears. My first sticker that featured a bear was the bubble tea sticker and since the first bubble tea I ever had as a child was the Taro flavour, I decided to name my character Taro."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Keycaps","links":[{"keyword":"@akwcaps","address":"https://www.instagram.com/akwcaps/"},{"keyword":"@akwstudios","address":"https://www.instagram.com/akwstudios/"}],"body":"In December 2020, I became invested in mechanical keyboards as a hobby and this led me on a hunt for cute custom keycaps. At the time I really wanted a Taro keycap so I attempted to make my own by learning through YouTube video tutorials. As an initial attempt it turned out TERRIBLY so I quickly gave up. \n\n A few weeks later I decided to reattempt it and as I made more I became more confident in my skills. I began posting them under @akwcaps on Instagram separate from @akwstudios as I was just playing around with artisan keycaps and did not want the content to interfere with my stationery account. \n\n As the account grew, I hosted raffle sales every few weeks and sold much more than what I expected! A few months later, I started thinking about combining the two businesses so that they can both be under @akwstudios but was not too confident in the idea. I created a poll and the majority vote was to combine them, which is why I have started to post everything under the same account."}]},{"section":null,"title":"illustrations","content":[{"item":null,"type":"Group","content":[{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_imbusy.png","alt":"I'm Busy Taro Illustration"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_wt.png","alt":"White Taro Candy Illustration"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_one.png","alt":"AKWSTUDIOS Turns One: Shop Update"}]},{"item":null,"type":"Group","content":[{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_sg.png","alt":"Taro in Squid Games Illustration"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_watermelon.png","alt":"Taro as a Watermelon"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_akwcap.png","alt":"AKWCAPS/AKWSTUDIOS Merge Illustration"}]},{"item":null,"type":"Group","content":[{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_beach.png","alt":"Taro in a Floatie on the Beach"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_marco.png","alt":"Birthday Illustration I Made For My Boyfriend"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_covenant.png","alt":"Valentine's Day Illustration for Food Donations to Covenant House"}]}]},{"section":null,"title":"product photos","content":[{"item":null,"type":"Group","content":[{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_tote.jpg","alt":"Rainy Ducky Canvas Tote Bag"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"AKW_busypr.JPG","alt":"I'm Busy!
