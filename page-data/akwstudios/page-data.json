I knew I wanted to base my shop off of my own original character, which is when I started doodling bears. My first sticker that featured a bear was the bubble tea sticker and since the first bubble tea I ever had as a child was the Taro flavour, I decided to name my character Taro."},{"item":null,"type":"TextBody","title":"Keycaps","links":[{"keyword":"@akwcaps","address":"https://www.instagram.com/akwcaps/"},{"keyword":"@akwstudios","address":"https://www.instagram.com/akwstudios/"}],"body":"In December 2020, I became invested in the keyboard hobby and this led me on a hunt for cute custom keycaps. At the time I really wanted a Taro keycap so I tried to make my own by learning through YouTube video tutorials but it turned out TERRIBLE so I gave up.\n\n A few weeks later I decided to keep trying and as I made more I became more confident in my skills. I began posting them under @akwcaps on Instagram separate from @akwstudios as I was just playing around with artisan keycaps and didn't want the content to interfere with my stationary account.\n\n As the account grew, I began doing raffle sales every few weeks and sold a lot more than what I expected! A few months later, I started thinking about combining the two businesses so that they can both be under @akwstudios but I wasn't sure if it'd be a good idea. I created a poll and the majority vote was to combine them, which is why I have started to post everything under the same account."}]},{"section":null,"title":"product gallery","content":[{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"screenshot of exploration stage"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"video of first prototype"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"screenshot of exploration stage"},{"item":null,"type":"Image","imageName":"cp_ideation.png","alt":"video of first prototype"}]}],"pageTitle":"akwstudios"}},
