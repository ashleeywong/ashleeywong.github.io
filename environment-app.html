			<h2>GOAL</h2>
			<p>propose a design for an application with an environmental focus and justify it with regard to the scientific theories that are presented in class.</p>

			<h2> created for...</h2>
			<p>anyone who wants to check information regarding common environmental issues around them. This includes the local air quality, wildlife dangers, areas to avoid, alerts such as earthquake and tsunami warnings, and recent news articles involving the area's environmental concerns.</p>

<!-- GENERAL/OVERALL SECTION -->

		<h2>how to use</h2>
		<h3>general</h3>
			<p>The users will be welcomed with a minimalist interface that will contain five major sections: <strong>environmental alerts, the weather, air quality, wildlife dangers, and local news.</strong></p>
			<p>Each section shown on the interface will be summarized for easy absorption of information. If users are interested in knowing more, they are able to press on each section which will lead them to the original site of where the information is from. </p>
			<p>The interface will turn a different shade of blue depending on the time of day that the user is checking the application.</p>

		<div class="proj-goals">
			<h3>alert banner</h3>
			<p>The "Alerts" banner at the top will remain a low opacity white when there are no major alerts or warnings to be shown. The banner will turn a bright pink and display a warning message if there are any issued by the government; for example, an earthquake warning.</p>
			<p>The section below the "Alerts" banner is where the location and weather information will be found.</p>

	<!-- AIR QUALITY / WILDLIFE SECTION -->
	<section class="project-section">
	<div class="proj-goals">
		<h3>air quality & wildlife</h3>
			<p>This section will show the air quality and wildlife dangers around the area you're in. This banner will change its colour based on the danger of the air quality. For example, green indicates that the air quality is good, yellow for moderate, red for very poor air quality.</p>
			<p>The animal listed indicates the wildlife to look out for in that area. This feature is to warn those that are doing outdoor activities such as hiking.</p>

			<h3>local news</h3>
			<p>This last section is where the local news is located. Only the news header and a very brief summary of the article will be shown. If users are interested, they can read more about each article by pressing on the desired item.</p>
			<p>At the very bottom of the application, users will find a row of dots and a lower case "i" at the bottom right corner. The row of dots is used as page control so users can swipe through their bookmarked locations and add more if needed. The lowercase "i" is there to guide users if they are having issues with the app or don't understand how to use it.</p>

	<!-- OVERALL INTERFACE GOALS -->
	<section class="project-section">
		<div class="proj-goals no-proj-img">
		<h2 class="h2-spacing">ideation process</h2>
		<h3>overall interface goals</h3>
			<p>I wanted the interface to be as simple as possible so that users can easily obtain and understand all the information they are looking for in one glance. Therefore, each section only presents a preview of the overall information.</p>

		<h3>why?</h3>
			<p>This allows for quick absorption of data without having to navigate through a plethora of sites. While these sections do present concise data, users will also be able to visit the full site of information when the desired section is clicked on.</p>
			<p>The lack of visual distractions present allows for the functions to be rapidly understood through its simplicity, allowing this application to be usable by people of all ages.</p>

<!-- IMPLEMENTED DESIGN PRINCIPLES -->
	<section class="project-section">
	<div class="proj-goals plain-proj-goals">
		<h3>the design principles implemented</h3>
			<p>The app's interface was designed with the Gestalt principles that were presented in class, this includes proximity, similarity, closure, and figure/ground.</p>
			<p>The principle of proximity is effectively used to create visual hierarchy. A combination of enclosing information into separate boxes and spacing them relatively further apart from each other is where this principle was used. This distance reduces visual clutter and prevents the contents from overwhelming the user with excessive amounts of information.</p>
			<p>Similarity is used for grouping similar objects. The small row of dots found at the bottom of the interface represents the different pages available. The use of viewing these dots as a group is to categorize and represent sections containing similar information, differentiating them from the rest of the information present.</p>

<!-- REFLECTION SECTION -->
	<section class="project-section">
	<div class="proj-goals no-proj-img">
		<h2 class="reflection-header">reflection</h2>
			<p>The overall design I made fulfils the goals of this project and has an interface that is easy to follow. Through the creation process of this environmental application proposal, it is evident that many processes and considerations go into the formation of an effective app.</p>
			<p>However, with the experience I have gained over the years since I created this project, I would like to improve the aesthetics of the interface and make it appear less childish. The interface below is a rough idea of what I'd change it to.</p>
