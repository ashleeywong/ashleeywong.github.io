			<h2>goal</h2>
			<p>create a wall sconce made of only wood and paper.</p>

			<h2>created for...</h2>
			<p>Children who are fascinated with outer space. This wall sconce was made to fit perfectly in any astronomy themed bedroom for those who can't sleep without a night light.</p>

	<div class="proj-goals">
		<h2>how to use</h2>
			<p>Use the edge of the crescent moon to rotate it to a desired position. The side with the crescent moon is where the light will be more diffused.</p>
			<p>This aspect of our wall sconce allows our design to be interactive for children and thus making this more unique than a typical plug-in night light.</p>
			<p>To turn the light on, simply use the handheld remote. The brightness can be increased and decreased as well.</p>
			<p>The handheld remote makes it easier for the child to control the settings from their bed no matter where the wall sconce is positioned in their room.</p>

		<h3>our sketches</h3>
			<p>These are the initial sketches of our wall sconce that we had come up with based on the user persona. Each of our sketches were based on different elements of a night sky; a star, cloud and moon. I suggested we incorporate a bit of each idea, as all three concepts are present in the night sky.</p>

			<p>We then created a rough prototype out of paper with a metal paper fastener that would allow the crescent moon to rotate around the middle. This prototype was lit up by fairy lights to test the result of our design. </p>

			<p>After this was made, it helped us realize that the light was not evenly distributed through the stars and allowed us to better visualize which parts of our wall sconce should be made with which material.</p>

	<!-- FRAMEWORK SECTION -->
	<section class="project-section">
	<div class="proj-goals">
		<h3>the framework</h3>
			<p>The material we used to create the base, lid with star cut outs, and crescent moon was pine wood. The layers that were stacked up in between the base and the lid was medium density fibreboard (MDF).</p>

			<p>We decided to use MDF for the layers because the pine wood was too thin and we would have needed many of them in order to build the wall high enough for the puck lights to fit inside with a lid over it.</p>
			<p>Another reason we decided to use MDF was because the material is cheaper and thicker than pinewood yet thin enough to laser cut.</p>

			<p>Pine wood was only used for the surfaces visible to the user.</p>

	<div class="proj-goals">
		<h3>the light diffusers</h3>
			<p>The translucent white and yellow material covering the stars and crescent moon cut outs were gold and white vellum paper. The purpose of using translucent paper was so that it diffuses and spreads the light evenly. The goal was to make the light not too strong as night lights should be only bright enough to give comfort to those scared of the dark while being dim enough for the user to fall asleep with it on.</p>

<!-- LIGHT SOURCE SECTION -->

			<p>We decided to use puck lights because the remote that it comes with is easy and convenient for a child to operate without having to get out of bed to turn on or off.</p>

			<p>In addition, the light settings are adjustable and would allow for customizable features.</p>

			</figure>
		</div>
		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Our overall design was a success as it was an interactive product suitable for our persona and purpose.</p>

		<h3>The Obstacle & Our Solution</h3>
			<p>The only issue we encountered during the entire process was when we accidentally drilled a hole off center on both the crescent moon frame and lid. This miscalculation caused the crescent moon to spin unevenly around the lid and was fixed by covering the hole with a wooden dowel with glue around it to secure it in place. Since the paint could not cover the flaw in our design, I suggested we glue one of our stars on top of our mistake.</p>
			<p>My team and I were able to overcome any issues fairly quickly and easily. We were also able to incorporate everyone's ideas and suggestions into the final iteration.</p>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>Through this experience of product designing and creating my own usable wall sconce, I learned a few new skills such as creating documents to laser cut and discovered a new area of interest in product design.</p>
